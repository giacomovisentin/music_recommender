SongVibeRecommender 🎵

This project is a music recommendation web app built with Python, scikit-learn, and Flask. Unlike recommenders that focus only on genre or artist, this tool finds songs that share a similar "vibe" by analyzing their audio features.

The entire process is detailed in my Medium article:

🚀 Live Demo

You can try the live application here:

Please Note: The backend is hosted on Render's free tier. If the app hasn't been used in 15 minutes, it "sleeps" to save resources. It may take about 60 seconds to load the first time you visit it. Please be patient!
